    <h2>Alexander Broom</h2>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>I'm Alex. I'm purusing a Bachelor's in Computer Science. My favorite hobby is creative writing. I currently work at a fast-food</p>
    restaurant near campus.</p>
    <p>My favorite thing about BYU-Idaho is Christ-like attributes the teachers emphasize in themselves. I</p>
    think learning about web design is important because a Computer Science Major is a very broad major and taking this course</p>
    gives me a taste of something I might want to potentially want to go further into.</p>
    <p>I have been an official member of the church for nearly nine years, since I was baptized at twelve after being adopted.</p>
    I don't have a favorite quote in particular from a church leader, but I can't go wrong with President Nelson's 'Think celestial!'</p>
    quote. My favorite scripture is Alma 7:12.</p>
