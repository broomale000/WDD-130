                What makes the Paibow deck so powerful is the fact that any card in the game can be added to this deck,
                giving it a high degree of versatility because other decks are typically held back by the colors their
                Commander is; in the Commander gamemode, only cards of the same color as the Commander can be used, but
                because Jared Carthalion is all colors, he can use any colors, meaning Painbow gets the best of all
                worlds: red's fast-paced creatures, green's immediate mana ramp, blue's card draw, white's healing,
                black's destruction. Having access to all colors also provides the benefit of using more powerful
                multicolored cards, as these require specific color combinations to play, and Painbow can leverage these
                cards to great effect, gaining an edge over the opponent. All this power is not for free though. The
                player must first enable themselves to have access to all of these colors by setting up first. In order
                to do this the player must strategize how to unlock all the colors through the use of multi-color lands
                and also green mana ramping cards. If the player is skilled enough to do this within the first few
                turns, then the player can potentially completely sweep their competition.

                One of the most powerful gimmicks this deck has is the use of Kavu's. Jared can choose to spawn one Kavu
                a turn, which can be used as cannon fodder, or saved to beef up later. Having 3/3 creatures at the
                beginning of the game is no joke. Especially multiple. Simply having the presence of Kavu's on the board
                makes many players think twice about attacking, not wanting to lose any of their creatures. Because
                Jared can spawn a Kavu every turn however, and the player weilding the Painbow deck can place down new
                creatures as well, this deck tends to outpace those timid players. Once the player weilding this deck
                has enough Kavus, the player can activate Jared's second ability and to two of them add 5 +1/+1
                counters, turning them in 8/8s in the blink of an eye that have trample, meaning that overkill damage
                goes to that player's controller. Used multiple turns in a row, the Kavus can become essentially
                bunker-busting bombs. The Kavus will force the player to block, but even blocking is futile because
                trample will still hit the opposing player. If someone happens to kill Jared, because it's Commander the
                wielder of Painbow can play Jared again next turn, and simply use his second ability immediately with
                Jared's refreshed counters. And with the ability of this deck to get land, having Jared die a few times
                and be placed down again immediately is easy to handle. Keep in mind, this is only the use of Jared.
                Jared makes the opponent seemingly have to play against two players at the same time. Painbow deck has a
                lot of other hard-hitting and punishing cards within its arsenal to help annihilate enemies.

            Since Painbow can have a potentially slow start, the deck is equipped with an abundance of countermeasures.
            The deck has at least one card for potentially any situation, and card drawing cards to help cycle through
            the deck to help the player find those cards. The philosophy of this deck is that the greatest defense is an
            annihilating offense. By have a variety of removal cards that can destry or exile creatures, artifacts,
            enchantments, lands, and other special spells, Painbow has an overwhelming amount of removal at it's
            disposal. This helps counter other players that also have slow decks, or even fast decks. Destroying
            anything for a player with a slow deck puts them back miles at the beginning of the game, and boardwiping a
            fast deck can force that player to completely start over and lose the tactical advantage they had only just
            last turn.
