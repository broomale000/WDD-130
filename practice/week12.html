            White: Unity and Board Control
            In a Commander game, white thrives on cooperation and board presence. Its strengths lie in support and
            control,
            often enabling allies through cards like Teferi’s Protection or Smothering Tithe. White decks frequently
            employ
            strategies involving lifegain, token generation, and board wipes to maintain balance. Cards like Austere
            Command
            allow white to handle various threats, making it a stabilizing force at the table. White's ability to
            protect its
            assets and allies often leads to its role as a peacekeeper. However, white can struggle with card draw and
            ramp in a
            multiplayer setting, making synergy with other colors or creative deck-building crucial for long-term
            success.

        <p>
            Blue: Knowledge and Political Leverage
            Blue dominates in Commander by shaping the game's pace through counterspells, card draw, and manipulation.
            Cards
            like Mystic Remora or Rhystic Study can generate immense value over time, pressuring opponents to play
            suboptimally.
            Blue's penchant for instant-speed interaction makes it a formidable opponent, capable of halting game-ending
            combos
            or disrupting critical plays. Beyond control, blue excels in political plays, leveraging information and
            influence
            to turn players against one another. Commanders like Talrand, Sky Summoner or Azami, Lady of Scrolls amplify
            these
            strengths, but blue often relies on careful timing and alliances to avoid becoming an early target.

    <button class="accordion">Black</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Black: Greed and Ruthless Ambition
            Black shines in Commander with its ability to exploit resources, often at any cost. Cards like Phyrexian
            Arena or
            Damnation showcase its willingness to sacrifice life or creatures for power. Black's themes of recursion and
            graveyard synergy provide it with unparalleled resilience, allowing it to reanimate threats or maintain
            pressure
            even after setbacks. In multiplayer settings, black often acts as a wildcard, using politics to turn
            opponents
            against each other while quietly building an overwhelming advantage. Commanders like K’rrik, Son of Yawgmoth
            or
            Muldrotha, the Gravetide thrive in environments where long-term planning and resource management are key.

    <button class="accordion">Red</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Red: Chaos and Explosive Power
            In Commander, red is the color of high risk and high reward, bringing aggression and unpredictability to the
            table.
            Its fast-paced strategies often rely on direct damage, creature combat, and powerful, fleeting effects.
            Cards like
            Dockside Extortionist can swing games by generating massive mana advantage, while spells like Blasphemous
            Act
            deliver devastating board wipes. Red’s impulsive nature makes it well-suited for chaos strategies, often
            forcing
            opponents to make difficult decisions. Commanders like Purphoros, God of the Forge or Krenko, Mob Boss
            embody red's
            potential to end games quickly, but red's reliance on fast, explosive plays can leave it vulnerable in
            drawn-out
            matches.

    <button class="accordion">Green</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Green: Growth and Overwhelming Strength
            Green’s dominance in Commander lies in its ability to generate massive mana, play large creatures, and
            destroy
            artifacts or enchantments with ease. Cards like Cultivate, Beast Within, and Craterhoof Behemoth exemplify
            green's
            ability to ramp, interact, and end games explosively. Green thrives on developing a strong board presence,
            often
            leveraging synergies with lands and creatures. Commanders like Selvala, Heart of the Wilds or Golos,
            Tireless
            Pilgrim demonstrate green's aptitude for ramping into devastating threats or overwhelming opponents through
            sheer
            force. While its focus on creatures and lands is powerful, green can sometimes struggle against strategies
            that
            circumvent combat or exploit its reliance on the battlefield.
